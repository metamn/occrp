<li>Rise Project Romania</li>
<li>The Bulgarian Investigative Journalism Center</li>
<li>The Center for Investigative Reporting in Serbia</li>

<li>Ceske Centrum Pro Investigativni Zurnalistiku in Czech Republic</li>
<li>BIRN Kosovo</li>
</ul>-->
<p><br />Our goal is to help the people of the region better understand how organized crime and corruption affect their lives. OCCRP seeks to provide in-depth investigative stories as well as the latest news pertaining to organized crime and corruption activities in the region. In addition to the stories, OCCRP is building an online resource center of documents related to organized crime including court records, laws, reports, studies, company records and other public documents that will be an invaluable resource center for journalists and the public alike.<br /><br />The OCCRP project has been, or is, supported by grants from the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Open Society Foundations. Also on this site are projects funded in part or done in partnership with other organizations including SCOOP, the Center for Public Integrity (CPI) and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). <br /><br />OCCRP has been awarded numerous awards since it was founded in 2007. The program's first project on energy traders, in cooperation with SCOOP, was awarded the Global Network of Investigative Journalists Global Shining Light Award for investigative journalism under duress. ICIJ and reporters from OCCRP worked together on a project on tobacco smuggling that won numerous awards including the Tom Renner Award for Crime Reporting from Investigative Reporters and Editors and the Overseas Press Club Award. A story done in cooperation with CIN in Sarajevo won an Online Journalism Award for investigative reporting. OCCRP’s stories have twice been finalists for the Daniel Pearl Award for international reporting and OCCRP’s story on offshore registration agents won the prize in 2011.<br /><br />OCCRP is a registered name of the Journalism Development Network, a Maryland-based charitable organization (501(c)3).</p>
