<p>They first intercepted the delivery of 5.5 kilograms of marijuana from Armenia to Canada. After this bust, they discovered another shipment from the same Iranian citizen. The second attempted shipment contained 3 kilograms of marijuana.</p>
<p>Authorities say that this was the largest drug shipment intercepted by Armenian officials this year.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Armenian authorities foiled the transport of 11 kilograms of drugs which were being transported into Armenia at the Meghri border, a crossing point between Iran and Armenia. This was the largest drug bust by authorities in Armenian history, according to Hetq.</p>
