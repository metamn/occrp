<p>Guatemalan authorities have detained 21 people suspected of laundering money for a Mexican drug cartel, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/guatemala-detains-21-money-laundering-case-21089509" target="_blank">according to the AP</a>.</p>

<p>Police and military officials arrested the suspects in a series of 35 raids throughout the country. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/04/us-guatemala-crime-idUSBRE9B30WT20131204" target="_blank">Reuters reports</a> that the group of suspects, led by two Guatemalans, included a Mexican national who is still at large.</p>
<p>Officials told reporters on Tuesday that the suspects used a fruit and vegetable company as a front to launder nearly US$46 million in 2009 and 2010. The network allegedly funneled millions of dollars to the Sinaloa drug cartel led by Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.</p>
<p>"We assume the money is from a Mexican cartel, the Sinaloa cartel," a Guatemalan attorney general said, referring to Mexico's dominant Culiac√°n-based drug gang. According to the AP, the Sinaloa cartel is Mexico's most powerful.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/guatemala-arrests-a-positive-stride-against-money-laundering" target="_blank">InSight Crime described</a> the arrests as "the latest sign that the country's culture of impunity is slowly eroding." InSight says that Guatemala has historically done a poor job combating laundering, as evidenced by former President Alfonso Portillo who went to trial in Guatemala and was later extradited to the United States.</p>
