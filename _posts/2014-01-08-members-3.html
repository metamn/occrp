<p><strong>Lowell Bergman</strong> is the Reva and David Logan Distinguished Professor of Investigative Reporting at the U.C. Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, where he has taught a seminar dedicated to investigative reporting for over 20 years. Yet he also manages to be producer/correspondent and consultant for the PBS documentary series "Frontline", as well as an advisor to several non-profit investigative news organizations. While teaching and working with “Frontline”, Bergman was also an investigative correspondent for the New York Times from 1998 until 2008.</p>
<p>From working on a weekly newspaper in San Diego in the late 60s, he became a freelancer for Ramparts Magazine, then an editor of Rolling Stone. In 1976, he was part of a group of reporters who investigated the assassination of Don Bolles, and in 1977 he was a co-founder of The Center for Investigative Reporting. From 1978 until 1983, Bergman was a producer, reporter, and then the Director of Investigative Reporting at ABC News. He was one of the original producers of "20/20."</p>
<p>In 1983, Bergman joined CBS News as a producer for "60 Minutes," where over the course of 14 years he produced more than 50 stories ranging from organized crime, international arms and drug trafficking, to terrorism, and corporate crime. The story of his investigation of the tobacco industry for 60 Minutes was chronicled in the Academy Award nominated feature film "The Insider".</p>
<p>Leaving CBS News as senior investigative producer in 1998, he forged an alliance between The New York Times and "Frontline". Resulting stories included an investigation into corruption in Mexico, the East Africa bombings, the California energy crisis and the role of Enron, a series on the roots of 9/11, as well as subsequent stories on the terrorist threat inside the US and Europe. Working with his students, The New York Times and "Frontline", Mr. Bergman also reported award-winning investigations of the credit card business, and worker safety in the iron foundry industry.</p>
<p>Honours he has received include the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, awarded to The New York Times in 2004 for "A Dangerous Business," which recorded egregious worker safety violations coupled with the systematic violation of environmental laws in the iron sewer and water pipe industry. The story is the only winner of the Pulitzer Prize to also be acknowledged with every major award in broadcasting. The recipient of numerous Emmys, Mr. Bergman has also received five Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University silver and golden Baton awards, three Peabodys, a Polk Award, a Sidney Hillman award for labor reporting, the <a href="http://live.psu.edu/story/30040" target="_blank">Bart Richards Award for Media Criticism</a> and the James Madison Freedom of Information Award for Career Achievement from The Society of Professional Journalists.</p>
