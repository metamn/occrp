<p>A new digital handbook designed to help investigative journalists track corruption across borders was introduced Nov. 22 at the European Investigative Journalism Conference in Brussels. The handbook which is published by the Romanian Center for Investigative Journalism and the International Center for Journalists (www.icfj.org)provides an array of new tools for investigative journalists that will help them give the public a better understanding of regional and global criminal networks.</p>
