<p>Fourteen years old when martial law was declared in the Phiippines, some of her earliest and most dangerous work was for underground publications. At one point she had to go into hiding for months. In 1982 she joined the staff of the Philippine Panorama, a widely read magazine. As Ferdinand Marcos gradually lost political power, Sheila reported on human rights abuses, the growing democratic movement, and the election of Corazon Aquino as president. She later joined the staff of The Manila Times as a political reporter, and also wrote special reports for The Manila Chronicle. As a stringer for The New York Times and the Guardian (London), she covered seven attempted coups d'etat against the Aquino government.</p>
<p>In 1989, she co-founded the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) to promote investigative reporting. The PCIJ trains journalists in investigative skills, and has provided an environment for in-depth, groundbreaking reporting on major social issues, including the military, poverty, and corruption. The Center has investigated and reported on major social issues including the military, poverty, and corruption. Under Sheila's leadership, the Center became the premier investigative reporting institution in the Philippines and Asia. She is also on the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists, the Media Development Loan Fund and the International Crisis Group.</p>
<p>Sheila is the author and editor of more than a dozen books, including "Coups, Cults &amp; Cannibals," a collection of reportage; "The Rulemakers: How the wealthy and well-born dominate Congress;" and "Pork and other Perks: Corruption and Governance in the Philippines."&nbsp; She has received numerous awards including the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Journalism, Literature and Creative Communication Arts in 2003, which further promoted the widespread recognition of her work.</p>
