<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/29/us-croatia-pharmaceuticals-idUSBRE9BS04G20131229" target="_blank">According to Reuters</a>, pharmaceutical managers tried boosting their drug sales by bribing doctors and pharmacists with cash, gifts, and free trips.</p>
<p>Suspects are accused of taking part in the corruption scheme between 2009 and 2012. &nbsp;If convicted, they could face up to five years in prison, <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/12/30/342774/croatia-charges-364-in-corruption-probe/">reports PressTV</a>.</p>
<p>The charges were the result of USKOK’s anti-corruption campaign “Hippocratus,” which launched in November 2012.</p>
<p>This is the largest number of people who have been indicted in Croatia since it became an independent country in 1991. The 800-page indictment has been recorded in the National Library in Zagreb, reports Reuters.</p>
<p>Croatia joined the European Union in July after increasing anti-corruption efforts.</p>
